# info
This project was a work done for Design 3305, a class for Ohio State University's General Design minor. The goal was to create a visual narrative, and I wanted to create a visual narrative of music, visualizing MIDI files! 

See [Starry Night Sequencer.pdf](https://wustep.github.io/midi/Starry%20Night%20Sequencer.pdf) for more documentation on the background and process.
