Starry Night Sequencer - Visualizing MIDI files with Starry Night colors and backdrop

Uses [MIDI.js](https://galactic.ink/midi-js/) and [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/)! 

[Demo](https://wustep.github.io/starry-sequencer/player.html) - Works best in Chrome and on Desktop! Press the 5th button from the left for notes to "stick", creating an alternate portrait of the song.

# info
This project was a work done for Design 3305, a class for Ohio State University's General Design minor. The goal was to create a visual narrative, and I wanted to create a visual narrative of music, visualizing MIDI files! 

See [Starry Night Sequencer.pdf](https://wustep.github.io/midi/Starry%20Night%20Sequencer.pdf) for more documentation on the background and process.
